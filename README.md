## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the country-wise and day-wise streams of all the top performing artists for the period 1st January, 2017 to 31st December, 2021. The data is sourced from Kaggle and has been processed using Power BI to create a database for easy management and analysis. Power BI has been used to explore the data visually and gain valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data of country-wise and day-wise streams of all the top performing artists for the period 1st January, 2017 to 31st December, 2021. The data has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts), which ensures its authenticity and reliability. The dataset includes information such as region, track title, artist, rank, streams, chart, and date.

## Data Processing
The data obtained from Kaggle requires some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Power Query Editor within Power BI has been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Technologies Used
Power Query Editor: For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation into the database.

## Notes
- I haven't uploaded the dataset for this project in the repo since the csv file size amounted to 3.2 GB. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle. 
- Similarly, I haven't uploaded the .pbix file of the project because of the huge file size. You can reach out to me in case you want me to share the original .pbix file for your reference.
